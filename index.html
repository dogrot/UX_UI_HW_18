                <p class="text">
                    Freshly graduated from the University of Minnesota’s online UX/UI boot camp. The class gave me a few projects under my belt and a good understanding of this field.

                    I strive to approach challenges from perspectives others wouldn’t think of, and often come up with more useful results because of this. I like to gather as much data as possible from as many different groups as I can, especially from groups that others might not consider asking, such as individuals with various disabilities and how they interact with the world.

            <p class="text">
                Ever since I was a small child, I've enjoyed making art. No matter where life has taken me, I've always had this outlet for myself. I've never wanted to be a professional illustrator, I feared that doing so would make my hobby feel more like a job, and risk losing my passion for drawing.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                When I discovered the field of UX/UI, it felt like the perfect balance of art and technology. I could use my artistic knowledge and skills in a way that made websites and apps into interfaces that looked pleasing to the eye and worked best for users.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                I'm still relatively new to this field, but my passion for this new path of mine far outweighs any fears I may have. I look forward to creating more products and gaining more experience to shape myself into an even better and more confident designer.
